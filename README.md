# ASP Story Generation Benchmark

This repository contains ASP encodings and prompts for the Secret Agent, Aladdin, and Western narrative planning domains, plus a Python benchmark runner scaffold managed with uv.

The code under `benchmark/` aims to replicate the pipeline described in “Can LLMs Generate Good Stories? Insights and Challenges from a Narrative Planning Perspective.”
